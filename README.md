Project Overview:Password Strength Checker

Introduction
The Enhanced Password Strength Checker is a Python program designed to evaluate the robustness of user passwords. It assesses the strength of passwords based on various criteria such as length, the inclusion of lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, special characters, and the absence of common patterns or easily guessable words. The program provides users with a strength rating and specific feedback on how to improve their passwords.

Objectives
Evaluate Password Strength: Determine the robustness of a given password using multiple criteria.
Provide Feedback: Offer suggestions to users on how to enhance the security of their passwords.
Promote Security Awareness: Encourage users to create stronger passwords to protect their accounts and personal information.
Key Features
1.Password Length Check: Ensures the password is sufficiently long to provide a basic level of security.
2.Character Type Checks: Verifies the presence of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.
3.Pattern Avoidance: Detects and flags common patterns or easily guessable words within the password.
4.Detailed Feedback: Provides users with specific advice on how to make their passwords stronger based on the criteria they failed to meet.
5.Strength Rating: Categorizes passwords into various strength levels (Very Weak, Weak, Moderate, Strong, Very Strong) based on the number of criteria met.
